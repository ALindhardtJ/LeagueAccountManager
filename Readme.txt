This is a desktop application written in Python, designed for managing and logging into your personal accounts in
the game League of Legends, aswell as showcasing relevant data related to each of your accounts. I made it with the
intend of personal usage only to begin with, but since i have come quiet a long way with the project i thought i'd
make it available to use for anyone interested.

1. Download and install 'python 3.9' from the Microsoft Store
2. Run the 'requirements.bat' file to install needed packages
3. Run the 'League Account Manager.exe' file
4. Enjoy!
